Art director\r\nNational average salary: $66,939 per year\r\nPrimary duties: An art director in the film may work on live-action or animated projects to create visually appealing productions for their target audience. Art directors collaborate with movie directors, screenwriters, and actors, plus animators or set and costume designers, to produce a specific tone and mood through the visual aspects of a film. Since this is a high-level role, it is useful to have a bachelor degree in design or a related field and to gain experience working on the sets of various movies.\r\n\r\n2. Entertainment lawyer\r\nNational average salary: $73,531 per year\r\nPrimary duties: An entertainment lawyer is an attorney who specializes in legal work related to the entertainment industry, including individual legal cases and business operations. These law professionals may take on clients like celebrities and actors to help them settle legal disputes, or they might work with studios and executives to ensure all \r\nareas of production follow local and national regulations. To become an entertainment lawyer, interested candidates must complete a post-graduate law program, during which it is useful to find internships in entertainment law.\r\n\r\n3. Executive producer\r\nNational average salary: $74,555 per year\r\nPrimary duties: An executive producer is a high-level industry professional who handles the general production of a film or, most times, a television show. The executive producer communicates directly with the studio in charge of the film and creates the direction for the production, including the general storyline, the budget, and which actors they want to cast. While there are no specific degrees required to become an executive producer, a few years of experience working at different levels of film production can help candidates get a job in this role.\r\n\r\n4. Videographer\r\nNational average salary: $77,282 per year\r\nPrimary duties: A videographer is an important member of a film crew who guides the direction of filming. While they often report to cinematographers or directors, the videographer typically has authority over their crew to direct the use of filming equipment, like choosing camera angles and creating visually appealing shots, and collaborating with other team members to edit footage for a finished product. There are film and video production degrees a candidate can pursue to increase their skills for this role, but the main requirement to join this career is prior experience in a film crew.\r\n\r\n5. Director\r\nNational average salary: $84,937 per year\r\nPrimary duties: A director handles on-set leadership responsibilities for film production and is often the highest-level employee on set every day. The responsibilities of a director include working with other high-level employees to establish the artistic mood and storyline of a film, directing members of the film crew and actors to fulfill their vision for the production, and requesting retakes or changes in the script during filming. A film degree can improve a candidates chances of getting a job in this role, but many studios prefer candidates with a few years of experience in the film industry.', 'Memilih-PH-4.jpg');
